   So what I need is for you to make something like the script I'm currently using for changing the facial features on the Player Character,
   
   (They're the ones labeled "eye selector", "nose selector" etc, in the "Redoing" scene, which is just what the character creator is called.) 
    
    but it needs to be able to swap out the current player prefab with the other prefabs in the folder labeled "Freshest Prefabs"
